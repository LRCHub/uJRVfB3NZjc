Seijaku ga machi wo tsutsumu yoru ni
Furisosogu shiro
Kazashita tenohira ni
Fureta shunkan ni toketeku
Hakanai hitokakera

On a night when the town is wrapped by silence
white pours down.
On my outstretched palm,
the moment it touches, it melts,
an ephemeral fragment.

Oto mo naku tsumoru
Hikari wo atsumete kimi wa warau
Ima donna oto?
Kotaetatte kimi wa
Mou nani mo kikoenai

It piles soundlessly.
You gather light and laugh.
What kind of sound, now?
Even if I reply, you
cannot hear anything any more.

Kurushii tte itte kure yo
Samishii tte itte kure yo
Mukae ni iku donna tokoro e mo...
Ikanai de yo doko e mo
Oitekanai de...
Bokura zutto futari de hitotsu darou...?

Tell me you're suffering!
Tell me you're lonely!
I'm going to meet you, wherever it may be...
Don't go, not anywhere!
Don't leave me behind...
We, aren't we forever, the two of us, as one...?

Furitsumoru yuki to tomo ni
Kiete yuku kimi wo
Dakishimeru koto shika dekinai yo
Kanau nara mou ichido dake
Kimi no koe ga kikitai
MOU ICHIDO TADA ICHIDO DAKE...
YONDE YO...

As you vanish away
with the falling, piling snow,
I can do nothing but embrace you.
If it be granted, just one more time,
I want to hear your voice.
One more time, only just once,
call ...

Utsurotte samayou hitomi ni
Utsutta hitoshizuku
Hai-iro no sekai
Tomatta mama yuki dake ga sotto
Furisosogu

Your hollow wandering eyes
reflect a single drop.
As the grey world
remains still, only snow quietly
pours down.

Tsumetaku natteiku yo
Modoranai sono koe
Tokeau koto mo yurusarenai
Ore no koe wo kiite yo mata waratte yo...
Namida sae karehate
Kimi no koto tokasenai...

You're getting colder.
Your voice will not return.
We're prevented from understanding each other.
Listen to my voice. Smile again...
I have even exhausted all my tears
and I can't stop you melting away.

Kanau nara kono koe
Subete ubaisatte
Itoshii hito e to ataete kudasai
Kimi ga inai sekai ni tada hitori
Nokosareru no nara
Kono mama... isshoni...
Kuchiteiku yo

If it be granted, my voice,
rob me of all of it,
and give it to the person who is dear to me.
If I am to be left all by myself
in a world where you're not here,
then like you... with you...
I'll rot away.

AISHITEIRU tada sore sae
Ienai mama towa ni
Tozasarete yuku
Kimi to no sekai
Sakende mo todokanai yo
Kimi no koe wa mou... INAI
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Locked forever in a world where
I cannot even say a simple "I love you",
that's what my world with you is like.
Even if I shout it, it won't reach you.
Your voice is no longer here.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Furitsumoru yuki yo
Douka furitsuzukete zutto
Kono mama subete ubaisatte yo
Hakanai koe no inochigoto
Kakikeshite subete

O falling, piling snow,
please keep falling forever.
Like I am now, rob me of everything.
Along with the ephemeral life of my voice,
scratch it all out of existence. Everything...

(Hakanai inochi wa ten ni nobori tokete yuku yuki no shiro ni somaru
Nani mo nokoranai yo tamashii sae nani mo kamo...)
