This is the awakening
Of my eternal sleep
No time to rust in it
No time to trust and keep

Innocence has used
My name to be dammed

After your wisdom there
Is nothing left so say
Take me away

Take me away

After your wisdom there
Is nothing left so say

Far and away
The end is here

We are here
Where the alders fly
