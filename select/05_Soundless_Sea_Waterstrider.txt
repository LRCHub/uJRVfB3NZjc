I believe every little piece of me
will fall at ease in an ever soundless sea
Dust to dust there's nothing on the surface
I dive in and let my vision readjust
All the lies we speak
All the dreams we seek
All the lies we speak
All the dreams we seek
I can see the wonder underneath
The soundless sea will sing it's song for me
Waste this life staring at an empty screen
forever dead from another new vaccine
All the lies we speak
All the dreams we seek
All the lies we speak
All the dreams we seek
All the lies we speak
All the dreams we seek
All the lies we speak
All the dreams we seek
